bot_kalshi_btc60_fable5.py - Kalshi BTC HOURLY bot (Fable 5 build)
===================================================================
Self-contained hourly bot for the KXBTCD series ("BTC price at X PM EDT").
Everything the bot needs lives under kalshi/btc/ (this file, the shared
btc/ signal package, strategy defaults below) EXCEPT the Kalshi API secrets
(KALSHI_API_KEY_ID, KALSHI_PRIVATE_KEY, BASE_URI, optional DRY_RUN_MODE),
which are read from the customer folder named by btc.env's customer_folder +
default_customer (e.g. D:/_projects/customers/suma/.env + kalshi_private.pem)
-- see the "SECRETS" block below. Every strategy parameter is defaulted in
this file.

STRATEGY (backtested on kbtc-60.log: 211 hourly events, Jun 20-30 2026,
~43k signal ticks - see analyze notes below):

  "Buy the FAVORITE at 65-80c when the volume Point-of-Control agrees,
   in minutes 10-30 of the hour, maker entry, TP +15% / SL -30%."

  * Side       : spot >= strike -> YES, spot < strike -> NO (the favorite).
  * Confirm    : LiquiditySR POC color must agree - POC below price (Green,
                 volume support under us) for YES; POC above price (Red,
                 volume resistance overhead) for NO.
  * Price      : favorite side's bid in [65, 80]c; rest a maker limit AT the
                 bid (no spread crossing, no taker fee on entry).
  * Timing     : entries only minutes 10-30 of the hour (<HH:30 per spec;
                 minute >= 10 lets the hour establish its range first).
  * Exits      : TP +15% (resting maker sell) or SL -30% (monitored, taker),
                 force-flatten 5 min before close - NEVER hold to settlement.
  * Re-entry   : after each exit the bot may re-enter while still inside the
                 entry window (multiple trades per hour, one position at a
                 time, never a position left on an hourly market).

  Backtest of this exact rule (maker fills, 3c adverse slippage on SL exits,
  taker fee on exits): n=369 trades, win 75.9%, avg +1.15%/trade;
  compounding 10% of PV per trade => +39% over 10 days.  Breakeven win rate
  for TP15/SL30 is 66.7% - the POC + minute>=10 filters are what push the
  favorite's win rate to ~76%; without them the same band is ~71% (= zero
  EV).  Rules tested and REJECTED (all -EV): signal-aligned entries at any
  band 30-85c, underdog entries, hour-open drift continuation, S/R
  proximity, big-cushion favorites at cheap asks, and letting the BTC
  monitor's STRONG signal DICTATE trade direction (win% collapses to
  61-66%, avg -3.6% to -5%/trade - momentum alone is too noisy on this
  market; re-confirms the signal-aligned rejection above).

  STRONG-signal CONFIRMATION (added after a live loss where the bot bought
  YES seconds after a STRONG SELL fired): a candidate only fires when the
  most recent STRONG BUY/SELL within STRONG_CONFIRM_LOOKBACK_TICKS AGREES
  with its side - YES needs a recent STRONG_BUY, NO needs a recent
  STRONG_SELL.  No confirming strong signal -> no trade (it never flips to
  the opposite side; the override tested above does that and is -EV).
  Backtested at 300s/20-tick lookback: n=235 (vs 369 baseline), win 76.2%
  vs 75.9%, avg +2.25%/trade vs +2.22% - a bit more edge per trade at the
  cost of ~36% fewer trades (less compounding throughput; PV10%=1.61 vs
  2.09 baseline over the 10-day sample).  Chosen deliberately over the
  cheaper "just don't oppose a strong signal" gate (n=267, win 75.7%,
  PV10%=1.67) because it's the version the account owner asked for.

  LIVE-PAPER REVIEW (2026-07-07, 46 paper trades over 2026-07-04..07):
  realized win rate 56.5% (vs 66.7% breakeven for TP16/SL20), net -$20.50.
  Split by side, NO ran 68% WR / +$4.95 (matches the backtest) while YES
  ran only 43% WR / -$25.45 - all of the drawdown.  Two changes made from
  this: (1) YES-side candidates now need a bid_lo+5c pricier entry than NO
  (see YES_BID_LO_BONUS) since a pump that flips spot>=strike + fires the
  STRONG_BUY confirm looks more often like a local top than a NO-side dip
  reversal on this sample; (2) flatten()'s first exit attempt now sells AT
  the bid instead of undercutting it by 2c (marketable already; the
  undercut was pure giveaway and partly explains realized SL exits running
  ~10pp worse than the nominal SL).  Both changes tighten/de-risk rather
  than re-fit the core rule - the underlying 75.9% backtest edge is still
  the target; 46 trades isn't enough to conclude the edge is gone.
