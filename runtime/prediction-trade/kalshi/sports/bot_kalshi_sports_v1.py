kalshi_sports_bot.py — orchestrates the kalshi_sports helpers.
=============================================================
Reads ``kaslhi_sports.env`` (SPORTS_LIST, MIN_VOLUME_USD, TOP_N_PER_SPORT) and:

  1. For each sport in SPORTS_LIST → filter_by_sport_min_volume_live(sport,
     MIN_VOLUME_USD) → store up to TOP_N_PER_SPORT live high-volume tickers per
     sport, e.g. tennis=[m1..m5], cricket=[m1..m5], …
  2. In parallel, fetch get_the_market_scores_kalshi() for every stored ticker
     and print the FIRST market's response per sport (for entry-logic design).
  3. get_live_bid_prices(ticker) for the top market of each sport — live YES bid
     per participant, e.g. {"Nadal": 49, "Federer": 51}.

Auth/HTTP reuse the v1 ``KalshiClient`` (via kalshi_sports). Read-only — places
no orders.
