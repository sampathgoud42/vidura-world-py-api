bot_kalshi_parley.py — Kalshi PARLEY (multi-leg combo) bot.
===========================================================
Builds ONE combined market out of several *live* sports matches and buys it
with a market order.  A leg only joins the combo when the match is genuinely
in play and the price already says the leg is close to decided:

    leg = a match where ONE participant's YES price is > PARLEY_MIN_PROB_C
          (default 80c = "odds > 80%"), the match is AT LEAST in its second
          set, and THAT >80% participant is the one LEADING that set.

Legs are combined through Kalshi's multivariate event collections (the
exchange's own parlay primitive):

    POST /multivariate_event_collections/{collection_ticker}
         {"selected_markets": [{event_ticker, market_ticker, side:"yes"}, …],
          "with_market_payload": true}
      → {"event_ticker", "market_ticker", "market": {…quotes…}}

The combined market resolves YES only if EVERY leg resolves YES (the
collection's own rule: "will only resolve to YES if every associated market
resolves to YES"), so the combo pays the product of the legs — the classic
parlay payoff.  That market is then bought with a MARKET order.

MARKET ORDER (important): the Kalshi V2 create-order endpoint has NO market
order type — every order carries a price.  A market order is therefore sent
the way the exchange models one: a MARKETABLE **immediate-or-cancel** order
priced at the current ask + PARLEY_SLIPPAGE_C (hard-capped at
PARLEY_MAX_PRICE_C).  It sweeps the resting book instantly and cancels the
remainder instead of resting — never a hidden limit order sitting in the book.

WHICH MATCHES (config, same shape as the sports bot's per-sport knobs):
    PARLEY_SPORTS_LIST=tennis      sports to scan (DEFAULT: tennis only)
    PARLEY_MIN_PROB_C=80           a leg needs a YES price strictly ABOVE this
    PARLEY_MIN_SET=2               match must be at least in this set
    PARLEY_LEAD_SCOPE=current      which set the >80% player must lead:
                                   current | second | off
    PARLEY_MIN_LEGS=2              fewer qualifying legs than this → no parlay
    PARLEY_MAX_LEGS=0              0 = take EVERY qualifying match

LIVE-ONLY: a match reaches the combo only after passing all three liveness
gates the sports bot uses — Kalshi market status (postponed / delayed /
cancelled / suspended / retired / walkover … are dropped), the sport adapter's
own confirmation (tennis: SofaScore live statuses), and the Kalshi milestone
live-scoreboard flag (``live`` true, ``completed`` false).  A match that has
not started, or that has finished, can never become a leg.

RISK — identical mechanism to bot_kalshi_main (per-sport knobs, PARLEY_ prefix):
    PARLEY_BANK=100                session bankroll ($); 0 = unlimited.  A new
                                   parlay must FIT in what is left of the bank
    PARLEY_CONTRACTS=10            contracts per parlay order
    PARLEY_STOP_LOSS_PCT=50        realized session loss >= this % of the bank
                                   → BANK-HALT banner, no new parlays (open
                                   ones stay managed)
    PARLEY_TP_CEILING_C=97         resting take-profit sell
    PARLEY_STOP_LOSS_C=20          entry-relative stop (exit at entry-20c)
    PARLEY_STOP_CONFIRM=1          breach cycles before the stop fires
    PARLEY_SL_FLOOR_C=15           hard floor — never hold below this
    PARLEY_DAY_LOSS_HALT_USD=60    API-reconciled realized-loss brakes
    PARLEY_WEEK_LOSS_HALT_USD=150  (fills + settlements, never internal P&L)

and the same order-safety rules as the other bots: NEVER BUY NO (legs are
always the YES side of the leading participant's market), NEVER SELL NAKED
(every sell triple-confirms an open position first), spread gate before
placing a resting TP, one entry per combination (persistent ledger), and
PARLEY_PAPER=TRUE to run the whole pipeline against the live book with no
real order.
