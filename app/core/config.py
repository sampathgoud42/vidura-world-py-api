"""Application settings.

Every value can be overridden with a ``VIDURA_``-prefixed environment
variable (or a ``.env`` file next to the project), e.g.
``VIDURA_DATABASE_PATH=/home/app/data/app.db``. Defaults are portable —
project-relative paths, paper-only — so a fresh checkout runs anywhere;
machine-specific values belong in that machine's ``.env``
(see .env.example and DEPLOY_ANY_MACHINE.md).
