User root folders may be recorded in the database in either Windows form

(``/home/sampath/customers/sampath``) because the same database file can be
copied between a Windows workstation and a Linux server.  Everything that
touches the filesystem goes through this module so the rest of the codebase
never has to care which convention a stored path uses.
