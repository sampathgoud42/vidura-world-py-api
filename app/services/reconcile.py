"""Reconcile the trade ledger against the exchange — two passes.

PASS 1 — settle stale OPEN rows.  A bot can miss its own close: it crashes
mid-exit, the market settles while it is between cycles, or a fire-sell fills
after the process is gone. The row then sits at ``open`` forever, its cost
counted and its P&L absent — and the CSV close-fallback may later invent a
sparse CLOSED row for it.

    stale open row  ->  is the ticker still an ACTIVE Kalshi position?
                        yes -> leave it alone, the bot is simply still in it
                        no  -> it resolved; take the true P&L from
                               fills + settlements and close the row

PASS 2 — fee-true-up of CLOSED rows.  Most bots book an ESTIMATE at close:
btc15 v4 charges the entry fee but takes the exit gross at the planned limit
price; btc60 books entry/exit cents with no fee at all.  Fees therefore
inflate profits and shrink losses on the ledger.  Every closed live row not
yet priced from the exchange is recomputed from fills + settlements — which
net fees out on both legs — and corrected when the booked figure differs.
Rows that already match (the sports bot books fee-true P&L itself) are
stamped ``raw['fee_checked']`` so they are never re-queried.

"True P&L" matters here. The bots' own ``realized_pnl`` estimates are the
figures a 2026-07-16 forensic pass found overstated by roughly $8k; fills and
settlements are what the account really did.

FILL SEMANTICS (decoded 2026-08-05 by joining fills to their orders): Kalshi
records every fill as the token the account ACQUIRED. A "sell yes" order is
held as NO bought at 1-price — the fill comes back ``side=no`` with the
complementary price — and vice versa. So every fill, buy or sell, is a cash
OUTFLOW of ``count x side_price + fee``, and each matched yes/no pair the
account accumulates auto-redeems for $1:

    pnl = -sum(count x fill_side_price + fee)
          + 1.00 x min(yes_acquired, no_acquired)      # pair redemptions
          + settlement revenue/100                      # whatever settled

That formula needs the market's WHOLE fill history (the pair count is a
conservation argument), so it applies when exactly one ledger row owns the
ticker. For shared tickers, the legacy windowed arithmetic
(sell -> +count x yes_price - fee, buy -> -count x yes_price - fee) is
provably equivalent per-leg — but ONLY for yes-held rows; validated on the
554-trade sports forensics, which is all yes. For a no-held row it inverts
the trade (that inversion shipped in every bot's TRUEPNL too), so shared-
ticker no rows are skipped rather than mis-booked.

Both passes stamp ``raw['reconciled']`` (or ``raw['fee_checked']``) and
``ingest.sync_trades`` refuses to overwrite stamped rows from CSVs — without
that lock the next 10s auto-sync would revert every correction to the bot's
own estimate.
